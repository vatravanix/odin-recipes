This is my humble attempt at Odin's first project, Recipes. I'm hoping I'll be able to create a basic recipe website, using what little HTML I've managed to stuff into my brain. Here's hoping I don't forget anything important!

Also planning to come back and evaluate once I'm done.

UPDATE UPON COMPLETION (30/04/25):

I know this is the most basic thing ever, and that it's the absolute earliest beginnings, but oh my god, that felt so fun.
Work got in the way just a little bit, and I have to always manage my expectations because that is going to be a running theme.
I can only take my time and measure my progress against myself, and 2 days ago I wouldn't have even known how to start this project, let alone finish it.
I'm really proud of myself, since learning new stuff can be hard. If there happens to be anyone out there in the world reading this, keep going.
I promise you, even after a short period of time, you'll surprise yourself, and that small joy is really hard to describe.
I hate cooking but I love my lil site!

UPDATE: CSS STYLING (2025-05-03 12:23:59)

Having completed the Block and Inline page, the assignment is indeed to start styling the recipes page with everything we've learned from CSS recently. That
includes the dreaded margin value, which continually breaks my brain. I'm updating this README to state I'm gonna give it a crack today and see just how ugly I can make the recipes page with some external css. I plan to come back and evaluate here once I'm done, keeping somewhat of a log of the journey to try and remind myself of the progress being made.

UPDATE: AFTER BASIC CSS (2025-05-03 13:54:31):

Feels like it took an embarrassing amount of time to code both the div and the individual elements within it to have a background colour that matched each other and stood out from the homepage background colour. I am absolutely certain that my current CSS code is bloated and ugly, and I plan to take some time to look at it in a day or so to see if there's any ways I could cut it down further. So far, though, alongside VSCode Live Server extension and the devtools in Chrome, I am starting to feel slightly a little bit comfortable with the box method. I think probably after another 6,000 years practising I might actually "get" it.

TEST: ACCESS FROM PI (2025-05-24 20:48:00)

This is me testing that I've cloned/synced this repo correctly over to the Pi. My thoughts are that if I've managed to get it right here, I'll have done it correctly over on the landing-page repo too.
