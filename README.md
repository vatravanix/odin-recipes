This is my humble attempt at Odin's first project, Recipes. I'm hoping I'll be able to create a basic recipe website, using what little HTML I've managed to stuff into my brain. Here's hoping I don't forget anything important!

Also planning to come back and evaluate once I'm done.

UPDATE UPON COMPLETION (2 days later):

I know this is the most basic thing ever, and that it's the absolute earliest beginnings, but oh my god, that felt so fun.
Work got in the way just a little bit, and I have to always manage my expectations because that is going to be a running theme.
I can only take my time and measure my progress against myself, and 2 days ago I wouldn't have even known how to start this project, let alone finish it.
I'm really proud of myself, since learning new stuff can be hard. If there happens to be anyone out there in the world reading this, keep going.
I promise you, even after a short period of time, you'll surprise yourself, and that small joy is really hard to describe.
I hate cooking but I love my lil site!
