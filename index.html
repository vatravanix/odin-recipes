        <p>I am not a big kitchen enthusiast. In fact, that's probably putting it mildly.</p>
        <p>However, in the best spirit of the project, here are three recipes I think are worth giving a go.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="recipes/smoked-salmon-sushi.html">Smoked Salmon Sushi (Sassy's Choice)</a></li>
            <li><a href="recipes/marry-me-gnocchi.html">Marry Me Gnocchi</a></li>
