    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound bacon</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) pack of gnocchi</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly shaved Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sun dried tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a heavy skillet on the stove; lay bacon slices flat in the cold pan, without overlapping. 
            Turn the stove to medium heat. </li>
        <li>After 5 to 7 minutes, the bacon should start to curl and brown. Use tongs to flip each slice over. 
            Cook the other side until as crisp as you like, 5 to 7 minutes more. 
            <br>Remove bacon from the pan; place it on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess grease. 
            Once cool enough to handle, roughly chop bacon. </li>
        <li>Add gnocchi to the skillet. Do not stir. Cook for about 5 minutes. Add minced garlic. 
            Saut√© until fragrant, about 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>Add chicken broth and slowly pour in cream; stir to combine. Add in Parmesan cheese. 
            Stir to melt. Stir in bacon, sun dried tomatoes, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes. </li>
    </ol>
